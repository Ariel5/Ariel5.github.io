<h2>Dall-E Google Editor Add-on Support</h2>

<p>I am maintaining this project with the few hours of my free time as a PhD student. If you have a problem,
    please email me at <a href="mailto:lubonjaariel@gmail.com">this address</a>. For questions about the Dall-E model, query tips, community support, or
    to contribute, please visit the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/dalle-mini/dalle-mini">model page</a>.

<h4>Privacy Policy</h4>

The Dall-E Images add-on does not collect or distribute any information about you or about the documents you are using it with.
<br/><br/>
<b>Required Permissions</b>

<p>
    The Add-On will ask for permission to connect to an External Service. This is used to call the Dall-E model API and retrieve the images. No information except for the text you enter in the Search textbox is sent.
<br/><br/>
The Add-On will also ask for permission to display a sidebar. It uses the sidebar to allow you to enter terms to search for images and display the images returned.
    <br/><br/>
    It requires no other permissions.
